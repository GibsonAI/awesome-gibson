Gibson Prompt

1. I want to create a sales contact aggregator agent. It will store company and contact information.
2. generate a “sales_contact” table with fields (company_id, name, title, linkedin_url, phone, email). Also create a “sales_company” table with fields (name). All string fields, except name, are nullable.
